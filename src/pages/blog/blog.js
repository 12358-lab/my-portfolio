              Learning how to learn is one of the most successful courses in
              Coursera. By McMaster University & University of California San
              Diego, is free and it teaches some learning techniques explaining
              why they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am going to try to map some of the techniques in the course to
              my context. Iâ€™ve been involved in software development and agile
              methodologies playing several roles including Business Analysis
              and Product Management. If f you are a developer or have any other
              role in a software development team, this could be useful for you.

              Software industry requires to be constantly updated, even if you
              work in a maintenance project, chances to get outdated or not be
              considered for a more exciting job increases if you do not learn
              new things on your own time, but how to achieve this? Let's
              consider that you already found a new programming language,
              library or framework that you want to learn, you have researched a
              bit and found some material but you are struggling about how to
              learn it quickly.

              If you are working on agile methodologies you might be familiar
              with the concept of POC. If something is unknown, just plan a
              small test so you can be familiarized with the new concept or
              library. As you intend to learn something new here, plan some time
              in your week to skim a book or a blog. Include also your finish
              time and some leisure activities.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've used a couple of approaches, the one that I like the most is
              to have separate calendars for my work and my personal life, so
              one regular day could look like this: At work I have a similar
              calendar with more specific work related tasks, and cook time is a
              face-to-face time that I spend with my husband. TodoIst, Trello
              and Notion works very well for this, my recommendation, just keep
              your system as simple as you can. Noticed that in my daily plan,
              hours are just part of the task name, as I usually have the same
              working hours, duplicate cards works for me.

            <h3>The Pomodoro technique</h3>
          </EuiTitle>
          <EuiText className="textBlog">
            <p>
              This works well also at work. If you need help to avoid some
              distractions, plan yourself for being 15-20 minutes working in one
              task, and give you 5 or so for being distracted. After 4 pomodoros
              you should plan for a longer rest, let's say 20 minutes. You can
              use Chrome extensions like Marinara Pomodoro Assistant if you want
              extra help with timing. Try different time configurations for a
              while and see if that works for you, if so, the habit will come.

            <h3>Focus on the process and not the product</h3>
          </EuiTitle>
          <EuiText className="textBlog">
            <p>
              In this technique, the idea is to focus on the learning process,
              for example, plan for watch a video tutorial today. If we were
              planning for the product, the tasks will be something like "create
              a simple app". The concept behind is that the product or outcome
              could cause stress and procrastination, but it is easier to focus
              on the process with small tasks and the outcome will be completed
              at some point. This technique is a tricky one for me. Like a lot
              of people in this industry, I am goal-oriented and my tasks at
              work always have a goal that I can thick on. What I am doing now
              is trying to create smaller tasks that become easy to finish in
              one session, for example instead of finish chapter 1 and 2, a task
              could be "skim chapters 1 and 2" so I can decide later my next
              task. What I need to balance here is to create small tasks with a
              goal that allows me to learn or practice something new, and mark
              it as done so I can have this sense of accomplishment that I need
              to carry on.

          <EuiText className="textBlog">
            <p>
              If you are learning a new programming language, try to include
              problems of different levels and work on the hardest ones for your
              current level. Most of the materials are made to increase the
              level over time, but you can jump to more advanced material or
              search for it on the internet.

              Tracking your daily routine for a while could give you useful
              insights about your habits, when you feel more energetic, what
              triggers make you succumb to procrastination and so on. Planning
              your day according to this data will make you more effective, for
              example in my case I have more energy at morning, so I plan for
              tasks that do not appeal too much to me first thing at morning. I
              was also planning for studying Monday to Thursday but it is not
              working for me, on Thursday I do not want to sit at my desk, and I
              was starting again on Sunday. So I will add a break on Wednesday
              and test it for a few weeks.

            <h3>Avoid multitasking</h3>
          </EuiTitle>
          <EuiText className="textBlog">
            <p>
              At some point I was amazed by people who could keep a face-to-face
              conversation and multiple chats "at the same time", not anymore.
              Multitasking is proven to be ineffective, not only in your
              learning process but also in your interactions, but how to
              overcome this bad habit that I have for years? In my case this bad
              habit grabs my mind in the middle of a conversation and take me to
              other unexpected places, and do not take me wrong, that is the
              diffuse mode working, the issue is when I will allow it to work.
              So I started to look for techniques for focus and concentration,
              and no surprise here, I ended up on meditation and mindfulness.
              The idea behind this is to take control of my thoughts so I can
              decide when I want to be focus on what. Remember, plan for leisure
              activities, exercise and rest, that is when you can have those
              mind journeys.
